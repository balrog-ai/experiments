You smell a hideous smell, and follow it to a patio chair. But the thing is empty. Hm. Oh well You see a patio table. Now why would someone leave that there? But the thing is empty, unfortunately. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the patio table. You make out a BBQ.

There is an open patio door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.

You see a fridge. Were you looking for an oven? Because look over there, it's an oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You see a counter. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. Look over there! a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is a closed frosted-glass door leading north. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.
