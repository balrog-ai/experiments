You are in a backyard. An ordinary kind of place.

Look over there! a patio table. Now why would someone leave that there? The patio table is stylish. However, the patio table, like an empty patio table, has nothing on it. You can make out a patio chair. The patio chair is stylish. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the patio chair. You make out an opened BBQ right there by you. The BBQ is empty! What a waste of a day!

There is an open patio door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

You find yourself in a corridor.



There is an open patio door leading west. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door. There is an exit to the south.
