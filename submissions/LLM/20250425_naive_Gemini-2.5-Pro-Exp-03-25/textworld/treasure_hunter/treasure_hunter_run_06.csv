Well, here we are in an attic.

You find yourself in a playroom. An ordinary one.

You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a desk. The desk is normal. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You think about smashing the desk to bits, throwing the bits into the garbage, etc, until you get bored.
