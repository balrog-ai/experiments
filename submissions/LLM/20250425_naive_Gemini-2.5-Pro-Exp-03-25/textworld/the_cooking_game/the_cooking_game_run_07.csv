You find yourself in a corridor. A standard kind of place. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.



There is a closed fiberglass door leading west. There is an exit to the east. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.

You arrive in a livingroom. An usual one.

You can see a sofa. The sofa is comfy. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one. There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door.

On the counter you can make out a raw purple potato, a raw yellow potato, a red hot pepper and a cookbook, so there's that. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.

There is a closed frosted-glass door leading north. There is a closed patio door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.
