Look around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a garden. Okay, just remember what you're here to do, and everything will go great.



There is an exit to the south. Don't worry, there is no door.

There is a green hot pepper, a carrot, a red onion, a tomato, a yellow bell pepper, a red hot pepper, a red apple and a yellow onion on the floor.

You can see a patio table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You make out a patio chair. However, the patio chair, like an empty patio chair, has nothing on it. Silly patio chair, silly, empty, good for nothing patio chair. You make out a BBQ.

There is a closed barn door leading east. There is a closed sliding patio door leading west. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door.

You are in a kitchen. An ordinary one.

You see a fridge. You see an oven. You can make out a table. On the table you can make out a knife. You see a counter. The counter is vast.

Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset.

There is an open sliding patio door leading east. There is a closed frosted-glass door leading north. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.
