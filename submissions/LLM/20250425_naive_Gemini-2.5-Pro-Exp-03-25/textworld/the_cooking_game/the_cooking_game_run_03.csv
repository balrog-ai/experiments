You arrive in a kitchen. A normal kind of place.

You see a fridge. The fridge contains a raw yellow potato. Were you looking for an oven? Because look over there, it's an oven. You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a table. But there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You see a counter. On the counter you make out a tomato, a red hot pepper, a yellow apple and a raw purple potato. Look over there! a stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it.

There is an open frosted-glass door leading north. You need an exit without a door? You should try going west.

You've entered a pantry.

You see a shelf. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a shelf, go to TextWorld. But there isn't a thing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is an open frosted-glass door leading south.
