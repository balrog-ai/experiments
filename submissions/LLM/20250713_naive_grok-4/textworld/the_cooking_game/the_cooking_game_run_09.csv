You've entered a kitchen.

You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a fridge. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You scan the room for an oven, and you find an oven. You make out a table! You see a cookbook on the table. You scan the room for a counter, and you find a counter. The counter is vast. But there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

There is a closed frosted-glass door leading south. There is an exit to the north.
