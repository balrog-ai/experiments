0,turn right,"<reasoning>
The player's goal is to get to the purple key. Right now, the observation says there's a wall 2 steps forward and a wall 2 steps to the left. Let's parse that.

So, the agent is facing a direction, and in front of them two steps ahead there's a wall. On their left side (which would be 90 degrees to their current direction) there's another wall two steps away. The immediate surroundings are blocked by walls in both forward and left directions. 

The possible actions are turning left, right, going forward, picking up, dropping, or toggling. Since there's a wall directly ahead and to the left, moving forward or turning left would probably hit the wall. So, turning right might be a better option to change direction without running into a wall. 

If the agent turns right, then their new forward direction would be to the right of their original direction. Since there's no mention of a wall in that direction yet, maybe there's a path there. The agent needs to navigate around the walls to find the purple key. 

The key isn't mentioned in the current observation, so the agent can't see it yet. That suggests they need to move around the walls to explore the environment. Turning right would allow them to proceed in a new direction where there might be open space or the key. 

Going forward isn't safe because there's a wall. Picking up or dropping isn't applicable here since there's nothing to interact with. Toggling would also require an object in front, which there isn't (it's a wall). 

So the best immediate action is to turn right to head in a direction that isn't blocked, giving the agent space to explore further.

a purple key 3 steps right and 1 step forward",0,False
1,turn right,"<reasoning>
Let's see. The current observation says there's a wall 5 steps forward and another wall 2 steps left. Now, there's a purple key 3 steps right and 1 step forward. I need to figure out the best way to reach the key.

First, let's break down the directions. The agent is facing a certain direction, but the initial problem didn't specify the starting orientation. However, based on the previous action of turning right and the subsequent observations, the agent is probably facing north. Let me confirm that.

If the agent turned right from the initial state, which might have been facing north, turning right would make them face east. Then, the walls are 2 steps left (which would be north) and 2 steps forward (east). But after turning right, moving forward 2 steps would hit a wall. Then, the current observation after the turn right shows a wall 5 steps forward (east) and a wall 2 steps left (north). So the agent is facing east, with a wall in front (5 steps east) and a wall to the left (north). The purple key is 3 steps right and 1 step forward. Since the agent is facing east, right would be south. So 3 steps south and 1 step east from the current position.

Wait, maybe I need to visualize the map. Let's try to sketch it out. The agent is at a position facing east. To the left (north) is a wall 2 steps away. Forward (east) is a wall 5 steps away. The key is 3 steps right (south) and 1 step forward (east). So the key is 1 step east and 3 steps south from the agent's current position.

But how does the agent get there? Let's think about possible directions. The agent is facing east. To go south, they need to turn around. Turning left would face north, which is blocked (wall 2 steps left). Turning right again (which would face south) would allow them to go south. So turning right again (now facing south) and then moving forward. But the key is 3 steps right (south) and 1 step forward (east). Wait, if the agent is facing south, moving forward would be south. Then, to get the key's 3 steps right (which would be east from the agent's new direction), but the agent is facing south. So right from south is east. So after turning right twice (original direction east, turn right to face south, then turn right again to face west?), wait maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, no. Let's clarify directions again. If the agent is initially facing east, turning right once makes them face south. Turning right again would make them face west. But the key is 3 steps right (east) and 1 step forward (south). Wait, no. The key's position is relative to the agent's current position and facing direction. The description says ""3 steps right and 1 step forward"". If the agent is facing east, then ""right"" would be south, and ""forward"" is east. So the key is 1 step east and 3 steps south from the agent's current position.

So from current position (facing east), to reach the key: first, turn south (by turning right once), then move forward 3 steps to get south, then turn east (but wait, after turning right, facing south, moving forward 3 steps would get them south. Then, to get east, they need to turn right again (facing east), then move 1 step. Alternatively, maybe there's a more efficient path.

Alternatively, after turning right to face south, move forward 3 steps, then turn right again to face east, and move 1 step. That would get them to the key. But first, check if there are any walls in the way. The current observation shows a wall 5 steps forward (east), but after turning right to face south, moving forward 3 steps – is there a wall there? The observation doesn't mention walls in the southern direction. So assuming there's no wall, moving forward 3 steps south, then turning east and moving 1 step. But the key is 1 step forward from the agent's original position, which after moving south 3 steps and then east 1 step would land at the key's position.

Alternatively, maybe the agent can go forward 1 step first. Wait, but the forward direction is east, which has a wall 5 steps away. So moving forward from here isn't possible. So the agent needs to adjust direction.

So the plan is: turn right (now facing south), move forward 3 steps, then turn right again (facing east), move 1 step to get the key. But before moving, need to ensure that the path is clear. Since the observation only mentions walls in the original forward (east) and left (north) directions, the south and west directions might be clear. So moving south 3 steps should be possible. Then east 1 step.

But the key is 3 steps right and 1 step forward. When facing south, ""right"" is east. So 3 steps east and 1 step south? Wait, no. The key's position is 3 steps right (east) and 1 step forward (south) from the agent's current position. Wait, maybe the description is relative to the agent's current orientation. So if the agent is facing east, then ""right"" is south, and ""forward"" is east. So the key is 1 step east (forward) and 3 steps south (right). So from current position, the key is located 1 step in the forward direction (east) and 3 steps in the right direction (south). That would place the key at a position 1 east and 3 south from the agent's current spot.

So to get there, the agent can either:

1. Turn right (south), move 3 steps, then turn right (east), move 1 step.

Or

2. Turn left (north) but there's a wall there. So that's not possible.

So the only way is to turn right (south), move 3 steps, then turn right (east), move 1 step.

But first, the agent needs to turn right. The previous action was turning right, leading to the current observation. Now, the current observation shows the key's position. So the next step is to turn right again to face south. Then move forward 3 steps. Then turn right again to face east, and move 1 step to get the key.

But the agent can't move 3 steps in one go; each move is one step. However, the problem allows the agent to take one step at a time. So perhaps the optimal steps are:

Turn right (to face south), move forward three times, then turn right (face east), move forward once, then pick up the key.

But before moving, check if the path is clear. Since the agent's current observation only mentions walls in front (east) and left (north), moving south should be safe until the key is picked up. Once the agent is south 3 steps and east 1 step, they can pick up the key.

Alternatively, after turning right to face south, move forward once, check if there's a wall. But the problem doesn't provide dynamic observations after each step, so we have to assume the path is clear unless stated otherwise.

So the chosen actions would be:

<|ACTION|>turn right<|END|>

Then move forward three times:

<|ACTION|>go forward<|END|>

<|ACTION|>go forward<|END|>

<|ACTION|>go forward<|END|>

Then turn right again:

<|ACTION|>turn right<|END|>

Then move forward once:

<|ACTION|>go forward<|END|>

Then pick up the key:

<|ACTION|>pick up<|END|>

But the user is asking for the next action based on the current observation. The current observation includes the key's position, so the agent needs to figure out the direction to it. The immediate next step is to turn right (to face south) because the key is to the south and east. So the first action should be turning right to face the correct direction.

Therefore, the first action to take is to turn right again, which would face the agent south, allowing them to move towards the key.

a wall 2 steps right
a purple key 1 step left and 3 steps forward",0,False
2,turn left,"<reasoning>
Let me try to figure out what the next move should be here. The current observation shows a wall 5 steps forward and 2 steps to the right. There's a purple key that's 1 step left and 3 steps forward.

First, I need to visualize the agent's position and orientation. Let's assume the agent is facing a certain direction. The previous observations had the agent turning right twice. Maybe after the first action, the agent was facing north, then turned right to face east. Then another right turn would make them face south. Wait, but the latest observation says the purple key is 1 step left and 3 forward. Let's think step by step.

If the agent is facing south after two right turns, then ""left"" would be east. So the key is 1 step east (left) and 3 steps south (forward). But wait, the current walls: 5 steps forward (south) and 2 steps right (east). So the walls are in those directions. The key is 1 east and 3 south. But the agent is blocked by a wall 5 steps south. That can't be right. Wait, maybe the agent's orientation changed differently. Let me consider another angle.

Alternatively, after the first two right turns, the agent could be facing west. Let's see: starting direction, say north. Turn right → east. Turn right again → south. Now, walls 5 forward (south) and 2 right (east). The key is 1 left (west) and 3 forward (south). But then the key is west and south of the agent. But the wall is 5 steps south, so the agent can't go past that. Wait, but the key is 3 steps forward and 1 left. So maybe the agent is facing south. Then forward would be south. The key is 3 steps south (but there's a wall 5 steps south) and 1 step left (west). So the path is blocked by the wall beyond 3 steps. But the key is at 3 steps forward and 1 left. So the agent would need to go 3 steps south (but can't due to the wall) or find another way. Wait, this doesn't add up. Maybe I need to reorient.

Wait, the latest observation says walls 5 forward, 2 right, and the key is 1 left and 3 forward. Let's assume the agent's current facing direction. If the agent is facing east, then forward is east. The wall 5 steps forward (east) would block that. The key is 1 left (north) and 3 forward (east). So to reach the key, the agent needs to go north and then east, but there's a wall 5 steps east, but the key is only 3 steps east. Wait, that can't be. If the agent is facing east, and the wall is 5 steps east, that's directly in front. The key is 3 steps east and 1 north. So the agent would need to go north first, then east. But how? Because if they are facing east and try to turn left (north), then go forward 1 step north to be next to the key, then turn right (east) and go forward 3 steps? But there's a wall 5 steps east, but maybe the key is beyond the wall? That doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe the agent is facing south. Then forward is south. The wall 5 steps south. The key is 1 left (west) and 3 forward (south). So the agent would need to go west 1 step (which is left from facing south) and then south 3 steps. But the wall is 5 steps south, so after 3 steps, that's possible. But how to get to the west 1 step. If the agent is facing south, left is west. So turn left (west), go forward 1 step to the key's position (since the key is 1 left and 3 forward from current position). Then pick up the key. But wait, the key is 1 left (west) and 3 forward (south). So if the agent is facing south, to get to the key, they need to go west 1, then south 3. But the path south is blocked at 5 steps. So maybe the key is within the first 3 steps, which is allowed. So the steps would be: turn left (west), go forward 1 step to the key, then pick up. But in the current observation, the key is 1 left and 3 forward. So after turning left (west), moving forward 1 step lands the agent at the key's position. Then pick up. So the correct actions would be: turn left, go forward, pick up. But the agent hasn't picked up yet. However, in the current observation, the key is 3 steps forward and 1 left. Wait, perhaps the agent needs to adjust their orientation first.

Wait, the previous actions were two 'turn right's. Let me track the direction changes. Suppose initially facing north. Turn right → east. Turn right → south. Now facing south. The walls: 5 steps forward (south), 2 steps right (east). The key is 1 left (west) and 3 forward (south). So from facing south, left is west. So the agent needs to turn left (west) to face west, then go forward 1 step to the key's position (since it's 1 left and 3 forward from current facing south). Wait, but if the agent is facing south, moving forward 3 steps would take them south 3, but the key is 3 steps forward (south) and 1 west (left). So after turning left (west), the agent faces west, but the key is 3 steps south and 1 west from original position. Wait, maybe I need to map this out more clearly.

Original position: Let's say the agent is at (0,0), facing north.

First action: turn right → facing east.

Second action: turn right → facing south.

Now, walls: 5 steps forward (south) from (0,0) to (0,-5). 2 steps right (east) from (0,0) to (2,0). So the walls are at (0,-5) and (2,0). The key is 1 step left (west) and 3 steps forward (south) from current position. Current position is (0,0) facing south. So 1 left (west) is (-1,0), and 3 forward (south) is (0,-3). So the key is at (-1,-3)? Wait, that doesn't align. Maybe the key's position is relative to the agent's current direction. If the agent is facing south, then ""1 step left and 3 forward"" would mean 1 step to the west (left) and 3 steps south (forward). So from the agent's current position (0,0), moving west 1 to (-1,0), then south 3 to (-1,-3). But there's a wall 5 steps south (from (0,0) to (0,-5)), so the path to (-1,-3) would be clear as long as there are no walls in between. However, the observation mentions a wall 2 steps right (east) from (0,0) at (2,0), but that doesn't block the path to (-1,-3). 

So the agent needs to get to (-1,-3) to pick up the key. Since they are facing south at (0,0), to go west 1 step, they need to turn left (which would be facing west), then go forward 1 step to (-1,0). Then turn right (facing south), go forward 3 steps to (-1,-3), where the key is. Then pick up. 

But in the current observation, the key is 1 step left and 3 forward. So the agent must first turn left (west), move forward 1 step to be at the key's x-coordinate, then face south again and move forward 3 steps. Then pick up. 

Therefore, the next action should be to turn left to face west, then go forward. 

But looking at the previous steps: the user's last action was ""turn right"" leading to the current observation. So after two right turns, facing south. The key is 1 left (west) and 3 forward. So the correct sequence is: turn left (west), go forward 1 step. Then the next step would be to go forward 3 steps. But wait, in the current observation, the key is 1 left and 3 forward. So after turning left, moving forward 1 step would position the agent next to the key. Then they can pick it up. 

Therefore, the correct action here is to turn left, then go forward. But according to the current observation, the key is 1 left and 3 forward. So the agent needs to first adjust their direction. Since they are facing south, left is west. So turning left would face them west. Then moving forward 1 step brings them to the key's location (since it's 1 step left from their current position). Then they can pick up the key. 

So the next action should be ""turn left"" followed by ""go forward"". But since the user is asking for the first action in the current observation, the immediate action is to turn left.

3,turn right,"<reasoning>
Let me try to work through this problem step by step. So my goal is to get to the purple key. Let me look at the current observation again.

The walls are positioned as follows: there's a wall 5 steps forward and another 2 steps left. The purple key is 3 steps to the right and 1 step forward. Hmm. So from my current position, turning left or right might help me face the direction where the key is. Let me visualize this.

If there's a wall 2 steps to the left, that means I can't go that way without hitting a wall. The wall 5 steps forward suggests that straight ahead is blocked. The key is to the right and a bit forward. So maybe I need to turn right to face the direction where the key is located. Let me check the previous interactions to see if there's a pattern.

In the previous steps, when the key was in a different position, the agent turned right twice and then left. But now, the key is 3 steps right and 1 forward. If I'm currently facing a direction where right is the way to go, turning right would align me towards the key's position. Then, after turning right, I can move forward towards the key. But I need to make sure that there's no wall blocking the path. However, the observation doesn't mention any walls in that direction yet. So perhaps turning right is the way to go next. Alternatively, if I turn right, then I might need to move forward and then adjust direction to get to the key's exact location. But since the key is 3 steps right and 1 forward, maybe after turning right, moving forward once would position me one step forward, and then turning right again to face the key's right direction? Wait, maybe I need to adjust my orientation first. Let's think again.

Current position: facing a direction where forward is blocked by a wall. Left is blocked 2 steps. Key is 3 right and 1 forward. If I turn right, my new forward direction would be where the key is partially. Let's map this out. Suppose I'm facing north. With a wall 5 steps forward (north), a wall 2 steps left (west). The key is 3 steps east (right) and 1 step north. So if I turn right (east), then my forward direction is east. The key is 3 east and 1 north. So after turning right (east), moving forward once would take me to east 1. Then I need to turn north (another right turn) to face north, and move forward 3 steps. But that would make me go past the key? Wait, the key is 1 step forward (north) from the position after turning right. So maybe after turning right, move forward once, then turn north (another right turn?), but that might be a left turn. Wait, if I turn right (east), then my directions are: forward is east, right is south, left is north. So to get to the key's north direction from that position, I need to turn left. Hmm. This might be getting complicated. Alternatively, maybe after turning right (east), I need to move forward once, then turn left (north) and move forward 3 steps. But does the observation mention any walls in those directions? The current observation only mentions walls 5 forward (north) and 2 left (west). After turning right (east), the forward direction (east) isn't mentioned as a wall, so maybe it's passable. Then moving forward once would get me to east 1, then turning left (north) and moving forward 3 steps would reach the key. But the key is at 3 east and 1 north from the original position. So moving east once, then north 3 would get there. But does that path have any walls? The original observation only lists walls in the initial directions. So perhaps the agent can proceed in that path. But since the previous steps involved turning right, then right again, maybe the current best action is to turn right to face the east direction, which is towards the key's location. Then, after that, the agent can move forward. But the current step is to choose the first action. So the best immediate action is to turn right to face the direction where the key is located, perhaps. Let me confirm. If the key is 3 east and 1 north, and I turn right (east), then moving forward once gets me to east 1, then turning left (north) and moving forward 3 steps. But maybe in the next steps, the agent can do that. But for now, the action to take is to turn right to align with the key's direction. Alternatively, if I turn left, but there's a wall 2 steps left, so that's not helpful. So the best action is to turn right to face the direction where the key is, then proceed forward.

4,turn left,"<reasoning>
Let's see here. The current observation is that there's a wall 5 steps forward, a wall 2 steps to the right, and the purple key is 1 step left and 3 steps forward.

Earlier, the agent turned right a couple of times. Now, the key's position is 1 step left and 3 forward. So from where the agent is, they need to adjust their direction to face where the key is. Since there's a wall to the right, they can't go that way. The wall in front is 5 steps, so they can't go straight. The key is to the left and forward. So maybe the agent needs to turn left to face the direction where the key is. Once facing left, they can move forward 3 steps, but wait, there's a wall 5 steps forward, but maybe the key is in a different layout. Wait, the key is 1 step left and 3 forward. So maybe the agent needs to turn left first, so that moving forward would take them towards the key. But before moving, check if the path is clear. Since the wall is 5 steps forward in the original direction, but after turning left, the forward path might be different. Wait, perhaps after turning left, the forward direction is now where the key is located. But the key is 3 steps forward and 1 step left. So maybe the agent needs to turn left, then go forward 3 steps, then turn left again to face the key's left direction? Wait, that might not make sense. Let me visualize this.

Let's assume the agent is initially facing a certain direction. Let's say they are facing north. The wall is 2 steps left (west) and 5 steps forward (north). The key is 1 step left (west) and 3 steps forward (north). Wait, but if the agent is facing north, then left is west. So the key is west 1 and north 3. But there's a wall north 5 steps. That seems conflicting. Maybe the agent's initial direction is different. Alternatively, maybe after previous turns, the agent's direction has changed.

Looking back at the history: The agent turned right, then right again, then left, then right, leading to the current observation. Let's track the agent's direction over time.

Assume the agent starts facing north.

1. First action: turn right → now facing east.
2. Observation: wall 5 forward (east), wall 2 left (north). Wait, if facing east, left is north. So after turning right, wall to the left (north) is 2 steps, and forward (east) is a wall 5 steps. Then, the key is 3 steps right and 1 forward. If facing east, right is south. So the key is 3 steps south and 1 step east. Hmm, maybe the key is in the south-east direction.

Next action: turn right again → now facing south. Observation: wall 5 forward (south), wall 2 right (east). Key is 1 step left (west) and 3 forward (south). So if facing south, left is west, forward is south. The key is west 1, south 3. So the agent needs to go west 1 and south 3. But since there's a wall 5 steps forward (south), maybe after moving south a few steps, the path opens up? Or perhaps the walls are in different positions based on the agent's direction.

Wait, the key's position is relative to the agent's current position and direction. So as the agent turns, the key's coordinates change relative to the agent. This is getting a bit confusing. Let's think step by step.

Current observation: walls 5 forward and 2 right, key is 1 left and 3 forward.

Assuming the agent is facing a direction where forward is the path with the wall 5 steps ahead. Right is the direction with the wall 2 steps. The key is 1 step to the left (so opposite of right) and 3 steps forward.

So, if the agent turns left, they would face a direction where left is now their new left, and forward is their new forward. Then, moving forward 3 steps would get them towards the key. But first, they need to ensure that the path is clear. The wall is 5 steps forward in their original direction, but after turning left, the forward direction might have a different wall. Wait, the current observation mentions walls 5 forward and 2 right. So if the agent turns left, their new forward direction would have a wall 5 steps away? Or are the walls fixed in the environment?

Wait, no, the walls are in fixed positions in the game world. The agent's direction affects how they perceive the directions. So the actual positions of the walls don't change, but the agent's orientation does. So when the agent turns left or right, their perception of which direction is forward, left, right changes.

So in the current state, the agent is facing a direction where forward has a wall 5 steps away, right has a wall 2 steps. The key is 1 step left (relative to the agent's current facing) and 3 steps forward.

To reach the key, the agent needs to:

1. Turn left so that the key's position becomes relative to the new forward direction.
2. Move forward 3 steps to reach the key.

But before moving, check if the path is clear. If the agent turns left, their new forward direction would have the key 3 steps ahead, but is there a wall in the way? The original walls are in fixed positions. Let's imagine the agent's current position and the walls.

Suppose the agent is at position (0,0), facing north. Walls are at (0,5) forward (north), and 2 steps left (west) which is (-2,0). The key is at (-1,3) which is 1 step west and 3 steps north. But there's a wall at (0,5), so moving north from (0,0) would hit the wall at (0,5). But the key is at (-1,3), which is west 1 and north 3. So to get there, the agent needs to go west 1 and north 3. However, the straight path north is blocked by a wall at (0,5), but the key is at (-1,3), which is along a different path.

But the agent's current observation says the key is 1 step left and 3 forward. So if the agent is facing north, left is west, forward is north. The key is west 1, north 3. But the wall is north 5, so moving north from (0,0) would hit the wall at (0,5), but the key is at (-1,3), which is on a different path. So the agent needs to go west 1 first, then north 3. But how?

Wait, perhaps the agent is facing east. Let's try that. If the agent is facing east, left is north, right is south. The wall 5 steps forward (east) and wall 2 steps left (north). The key is 1 step left (north) and 3 steps forward (east). So the key is at (3,1) if the agent is at (0,0), facing east. But the wall is at (5,0). So the agent can move east 3 steps to (3,0), then north 1 step to (3,1), which is the key. But how does that align with the observation?

Alternatively, maybe the agent is facing south. Then left is east, right is west. Wall 5 steps forward (south), wall 2 steps right (west). Key is 1 step left (east) and 3 steps forward (south). So the key is at (1, -3). But the agent is at (0,0), facing south. To get to the key, they need to go east 1 and south 3. But the wall is south 5, so moving south would hit the wall at (0,-5). However, the key is at (1,-3), which is east 1 and south 3. So the agent can turn left (east), then move forward 3 steps to (3,0), then move south 3 steps? But the wall is at (0,-5), so moving south from (0,0) is blocked after 5 steps, but maybe the key is at (1,-3), which is within the 5 steps. Wait, but the agent can't move through walls. So perhaps the path is clear from (0,0) south to (0,-3), then east to (1,-3). But how does the agent navigate around the walls?

This is getting complicated. Let's return to the current observation: walls 5 forward, 2 right; key is 1 left and 3 forward. The agent needs to reach the key. The key is in a direction that is left and forward from the agent's current position. So the best approach is to turn left, making the key's position 3 steps forward in the new direction. Then move forward 3 steps to pick up the key. However, before moving, the agent should check if there's a wall in that path. But according to the current observation, the only walls are 5 forward (original direction) and 2 right (original direction). After turning left, the forward direction's wall distance isn't mentioned, so perhaps it's clear. Alternatively, maybe the walls are fixed in the environment, so turning left doesn't change the wall positions but changes the agent's orientation. So the agent's forward direction after turning left would have a different wall distance. Wait, no—the walls are in fixed positions in the game world. The agent's orientation affects how they perceive directions, but the actual distances to walls are based on their position and the real world layout.

This is a bit confusing. Let's try to think of it as the agent's current orientation. Suppose the agent is facing north. Walls are to the east (5 steps) and north (2 steps left, which is west). The key is west 1 and north 3. But the wall is north 5, so moving north from (0,0) would hit the wall at (0,5), but the key is at (-1,3), which is on a different path. So the agent needs to go west 1 to (-1,0), then north 3 to (-1,3). But how to get to west 1? If the agent turns left (west), then moves forward 1 step to (-1,0), then turns north (right), and moves forward 3 steps. But does the agent know there's a wall north beyond 5 steps? Maybe not; the observation only tells what's immediately around. So perhaps the agent can proceed.

But in the current observation, after turning right, the agent's new forward direction would have different walls. Wait, the current observation is: walls 5 forward, 2 right, key 1 left and 3 forward. So if the agent turns left, their new forward direction's wall distance isn't specified, but the key is now 3 steps forward in that new direction. However, the previous steps might have indicated that certain directions have walls. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to adjust their direction to face the key. Since the key is 1 step left and 3 forward, the agent should turn left to face a direction where the key is directly ahead 3 steps. Then move forward 3 times to reach it. But before moving, check if there's a wall. However, the current observation only mentions walls 5 forward and 2 right in the current orientation. After turning left, the forward direction's wall distance isn't mentioned, so perhaps it's safe to assume there's no wall in the first 3 steps. 

So the plan is: turn left to face the direction where the key is 3 steps forward, then move forward three times. But the agent should pick up the key once it's in front. However, the 'pick up' action can only be used if the key is directly below the agent, i.e., when they are one step away. So moving forward three steps would bring the key into the agent's current position, allowing them to pick it up. 

Therefore, the next action should be to turn left to align with the key's position, then go forward three times. But the agent needs to do this in steps. Since the current observation shows the key is 1 left and 3 forward, turning left would make the key 3 steps forward. Then, the agent can move forward three times. However, the problem is that the agent can only output one action at a time. So the first action is to turn left to face the correct direction, then the next actions would be go forward three times, then pick up. But in the current step, the agent needs to choose the first action. 

Looking at the previous steps, the agent had to turn right a few times to reorient. Now, in the current observation, the key is 1 left and 3 forward. So turning left would align the agent to face the direction where the key is 3 steps ahead. Therefore, the correct action is to turn left, then in subsequent steps move forward three times and pick up. 

But the user is asking for the next action based on the current observation. So the immediate action should be to turn left to face the correct direction. Once that's done, the agent can move forward three times. But since the agent can only pick up when the key is directly below, which would be after moving forward three times, the correct sequence is turn left, then go forward three times, then pick up. 

However, the agent must avoid repeating the same action if nothing changes. So turning left once should be sufficient to face the key's direction. Then moving forward each time until the key is picked up. 

Therefore, the first action the agent should take is to turn left to face the direction where the key is 3 steps ahead.

a wall 2 steps left
a purple key 3 steps right and 1 step forward",0,False
5,turn right,"<reasoning>
Let's see where I need to go. My current goal is to get the purple key.

Looking at the observation, there's a wall 5 steps forward and another wall 2 steps left. The purple key is 3 steps right and 1 step forward. Hmm. 

From previous steps, I remember turning right and left to adjust my direction. Now, I need to figure out the direction to face to reach the key. Since the key is to the right and a bit forward, maybe I should face right first. Let me check my current facing direction. 

In the previous observations, after turning right, left, right, left a couple of times, I might have ended up facing north or another direction. Wait, the initial directions might be based on the starting point. Let's assume the agent starts facing a certain direction. For example, if the agent starts facing east, turning right would make them face south, then right again would be west, then right again north, etc. But tracking exact directions from the turns might be tricky. 

Alternatively, maybe the key is located in a relative position. The key is 3 steps to the right and 1 forward. If I'm facing the right direction, moving forward would get me closer. Since the walls are blocking straight forward (5 steps forward is a wall), that path isn't available. So I need to adjust my direction. 

If the key is 3 steps right and 1 forward, perhaps I should turn right to face a direction where right is the side with the key. Turning right once would face me south, then moving forward might not help. Wait, maybe I need to face east again? Let me think. 

Alternatively, maybe I need to turn around. If I turn right twice, that would make me face west. Then, moving forward might not help. The key is to the right (east) and forward from there. Hmm. 

Wait, in the current observation, the key is 3 steps right and 1 step forward. If I'm facing north, then right would be east, and forward would be north. So to get to the key, I need to go east 3 steps and then north 1 step? But the wall is 5 steps forward, which would be north in that case. So moving north directly is blocked. 

Therefore, maybe I need to turn right (east) first, then move forward until I hit a wall, then turn north? Wait, but the key is 3 steps right (east) and 1 forward (north). If I go east 3 steps, then north 1 step, that should reach the key. But moving forward from the initial position is blocked by a wall. 

Alternatively, perhaps the agent needs to navigate around the walls. Since moving forward is blocked, turning right (so facing east) might allow moving forward without hitting the wall. Then, moving forward until the wall is 2 steps left (from the observation, wall 2 steps left when facing east). Wait, the current observation says a wall 2 steps left. If I'm facing east, left would be north. So moving forward east would hit a wall 5 steps ahead, but left (north) is 2 steps. 

Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me try to visualize. 

Assume the agent is facing north initially. 

- First observation: wall 2 forward, wall 2 left. So if facing north, wall 2 forward (north) and wall 2 left (west). 

Then the agent turned right (now facing east), next observation: wall 5 forward (east), wall 2 left (north). Key is 3 right (south) and 1 forward (east). So key is south-east direction? Wait, maybe not. 

Alternatively, the key's position is relative to the agent's current direction. If the agent turns right, their forward direction changes. 

This is getting complicated. Maybe the best approach is to alternate turning right and left to face the direction where the key is. Since the key is to the right and forward, perhaps turning right would align the agent's forward direction with the key's location. 

In the current observation, the key is 3 steps right and 1 forward. If the agent turns right, their new forward direction would be south (assuming they were facing east). Then, moving forward 1 step would get them closer. But there's a wall 5 steps forward, which is south in this case. Wait, but the key is 3 steps right (east) and 1 forward (south). So if the agent turns right (south), then moves forward 1 step (south), but the wall is 5 steps forward (south), so moving forward once would hit the wall. That's not good. 

Alternatively, if the agent turns left, facing west. Then, moving right would be east. The key is 3 steps right (east) and 1 forward (west). So moving forward 1 step west would be towards the wall. Not helpful. 

Hmm. Maybe the agent needs to turn around. If they turn right twice (south then west), then moving forward might not be possible due to walls. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to pick up the key once they reach it. So the key's position is key 3 steps right and 1 forward. So the agent needs to adjust their direction so that moving forward and right gets them to the key. 

Perhaps the optimal path is to turn right, then move forward until the wall is 2 steps left (as per the current observation). Wait, in the current observation, wall 5 steps forward and wall 2 steps left. If the agent turns right, their new left direction is north. The wall 2 steps left would be north. Moving forward (east) 5 steps is a wall, but the key is 3 steps right (south) and 1 forward (east). Wait, this is confusing. 

Maybe I should try to model the agent's position and direction. Let's assume the agent starts at position (0,0), facing north. 

First observation: wall 2 forward (north), wall 2 left (west). 

Agent turns right (now facing east). 

Next observation: wall 5 forward (east), wall 2 left (north). 

Key is 3 steps right (south) and 1 forward (east). From current position (0,0), facing east. Key is 3 south (to (0,-3)) and 1 east (to (1,0)). Wait, that doesn't add up. Maybe the coordinates need to be adjusted. 

Alternatively, when facing east, moving right would be south? No, right is clockwise. If facing east, right is south, left is north. 

So key is 3 steps right (south) and 1 forward (east) from current position. So current position is (0,0), facing east. Key is at (1, -3). So to get there, the agent needs to move forward east once, then turn south and move 3 steps. But moving east once would hit the wall 5 steps east. Wait, the current observation after turning right says wall 5 steps forward (east). So moving forward once would hit the wall. That's a problem. 

Hmm, maybe the agent needs to turn left instead. If facing east, turning left would face north. Then, the key is 3 steps right (east) and 1 forward (north). So from (0,0) facing north, the key is at (3,1). But how to get there? 

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to adjust their direction to face south. If they turn right twice (east then south), then their forward direction is south. The key is 3 steps right (east) and 1 forward (south). So from (0,0) facing south, moving forward once would be (0,-1), then turning east and moving 3 steps to (3,-1). But the walls: current observation says wall 5 steps forward (south) and wall 2 steps right (east). So moving forward once would hit the wall. Not possible. 

This is getting too complicated. Maybe the best course of action is to continue turning right and left to find the correct direction, then move forward when possible. 

Looking at the current observation: wall 5 forward, wall 2 left, key 3 right and 1 forward. The key is to the right and forward. So perhaps the agent should turn right to face the direction where right is east, then move forward. But moving forward is blocked by a wall. So maybe turn right again to face south, then move forward? But the wall is 5 steps forward. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to toggle something or pick up the key once in reach. But how? 

Wait, the key is 3 steps right and 1 forward. If the agent can face a direction where moving forward and right gets them there. For example, if facing north, right is east, so moving east 3 and north 1. But moving north 1 is forward from north. But there's a wall 5 steps forward (north). So that's blocked. 

Alternatively, if the agent turns right (east), then turns right again (south), then moves forward 1 step (south), but the wall is 5 steps forward. So that's not possible. 

I think the agent needs to alternate turning right and left to align their direction with the key's position. Let's see:

Previous actions were turn right, turn right, turn left, turn right, turn left. Now in the current observation, key is 3 right and 1 forward. 

Perhaps the agent should turn right again to face a direction where moving forward and right leads to the key. 

If the agent turns right, their new direction is south (assuming previous direction was east). Then, moving forward 1 step (south) would hit the wall. Not helpful. 

Alternatively, turn left to face west. Then, moving right (east) 3 steps and forward (west) 1 step. But moving west 1 step would be against the wall 2 steps left (north). Not sure. 

Wait, the wall 2 steps left when facing west would be south. So moving forward (west) would be okay. But the key is 3 steps right (east) and 1 forward (west). So from current position facing west, moving forward (west) 1 step, then turning east and moving 3 steps. But moving west 1 step would be okay if there's no wall. But the current observation says wall 5 steps forward (west) when facing west? No, in the current observation, wall 5 steps forward is in the original direction (north?), but after turning, it depends. 

This is really confusing without a map. Maybe the best approach is to continue turning right until the direction aligns with the key's location. 

In the current observation, the key is 3 steps right and 1 forward. If the agent turns right, their new forward direction is south. Then, moving forward 1 step (south) would hit the wall, but the key is 3 steps right (east) and 1 forward (south). So from the agent's position, moving east 3 and south 1. But how to get there? 

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to move in a different order. For example, move right 3 steps, then forward 1. But how to navigate around the walls. 

Since moving forward is blocked by a wall 5 steps away, the agent can't go straight. So they need to turn to face a direction where the key is accessible. 

Another approach: the agent needs to face a direction where moving forward and taking steps to the right gets them to the key. 

If the agent turns right, their forward direction is south. The key is 3 steps right (east) and 1 forward (south). So from the agent's position, moving east 3 and south 1. But to get there, they need to move east first, but moving east is blocked by a wall 5 steps away. 

So that's not possible. 

Alternatively, if the agent turns left (west), their forward direction is north. The key is 3 steps right (east) and 1 forward (north). So from their position, moving north 1 and east 3. But moving north 1 is forward, which is blocked by a wall 5 steps. 

Hmm. Maybe the agent needs to toggle an object or pick up something else, but there's no mention of other objects. 

Wait, the key is the only object mentioned. So the agent's only goal is to reach the key. 

Given the walls, the agent must navigate around them. Since moving forward is blocked, they need to turn to face a direction where the key is accessible. 

In the current observation, the key is 3 steps right and 1 forward. If the agent turns right twice (east then south), their forward direction is south. Then, moving forward 1 step (south) is a wall. Not helpful. 

Alternatively, turn left twice (west then north). Then, moving forward (north) is blocked. 

This suggests that the agent needs to find a path that goes around the walls to reach the key. 

But without knowing the exact map layout, it's hard to plan. 

Perhaps the best action is to continue turning right to change direction and see if the key comes into reach. 

In the previous steps, the agent turned right and left alternately to adjust direction. Given that the key's position changes slightly each time, maybe turning right again will align the agent's direction to face the key properly. 

So the chosen action would be to turn right again.

6,Failed to obtain a valid action from the reasoning.,"<reasoning>
Let's see. I need to get to the purple key. The current observation says there's a wall 5 steps forward, a wall 2 steps to the right, and the purple key is 1 step left and 3 steps forward.

Hmm. So my agent is probably facing a certain direction. Let me try to visualize the environment. The walls are in front, right, and the key is to the left and a bit forward. 

Earlier observations had the key moving around a bit, but now it's 1 left and 3 forward. The agent must be facing a direction where forward is blocked by a wall. The key is to the left (so maybe I need to turn left) and three steps forward. Wait, but the wall is 5 steps forward, so maybe the agent's forward direction is blocked by a wall, but the key is 3 steps ahead, but I can't go straight because of the wall. 

Wait, perhaps the agent is facing north. The wall 5 steps forward would be north. The wall 2 steps to the right would be east. The key is 1 left (west) and 3 steps forward (north). But if the agent is facing north, then moving forward would hit the wall. So to get to the key, which is west and north, but north is blocked. Maybe the agent needs to turn west first? Let me check the previous actions. 

Looking back at the history, the user kept alternating between turning right and left. Maybe the agent is oscillating between directions trying to find the path. 

The key is 1 step left and 3 forward. If the agent is facing north, left would be west. But moving west 1 step and forward 3 would get to the key. But the agent can't move forward 3 steps because there's a wall 5 steps forward. Wait, that doesn't add up. Maybe the agent's current position is such that forward is north, but the wall is 5 steps north. The key is west 1 and north 3. So from the agent's position, moving west 1 would clear the wall in front? Or maybe not. Let's think. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent needs to turn left (west) and then move forward 3 steps, but there's a wall 2 steps to the right (which would be south, if facing west). So if facing west, the wall to the right is south, 2 steps. The key is 1 step left (north) and 3 steps forward (west). Wait, that would mean the key is north 1 and west 3? No, the observation says 1 step left and 3 forward. If facing west, left would be north, and forward is west. So the key is north 1 and west 3. But how does that fit with the walls?

Alternatively, maybe the agent's current orientation is east. Then left would be north, forward is east (but wall 5 steps east). The key is 1 left (north) and 3 forward (east). But east is blocked by a wall. That can't be. 

Wait, maybe the agent is facing south. Then forward would be south, blocked by a wall. Left would be west. The key is 1 left (west) and 3 forward (south). But south is blocked. That doesn't make sense. 

Hmm. Maybe I need to track the agent's direction based on previous actions. The user's previous responses were turning right, left, right, left, etc. Let's see. 

First observation: walls forward 2, left 2. The agent turned right. So if initially facing north, turning right would face east. 

Next observation: walls forward 5, left 2. The purple key is 3 steps right and 1 forward. If facing east, forward is east (wall 5 steps). Right would be south. The key is 3 steps right (south) and 1 forward (east). So from facing east, the key is south 3 and east 1. But that's not matching the current observation. Maybe the agent's direction changed again. 

This is getting a bit confusing. Perhaps I should focus on the current observation: walls forward 5, right 2, key is left 1 and forward 3. The agent is holding nothing. The key's position relative to the agent is left (so agent's left direction) and 3 steps forward. So if the agent turns left, that would face west, and then moving forward 3 steps would get to the key. But wait, the wall is 5 steps forward in whatever direction the agent is currently facing. Wait, in the current observation, the walls are 5 steps forward and 2 steps right. So if the agent is facing north, forward is north (wall 5), right is east (wall 2). The key is 1 left (west) and 3 forward (north). But north is blocked by a wall. So how can the key be 3 steps forward if that direction is blocked? That doesn't make sense. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent is facing west. Then forward is west (wall 5), right is south (wall 2). The key is 1 left (north) and 3 forward (west). So to reach the key, the agent would need to go west 3 steps, but the wall is 5 steps west. That's impossible. 

Wait, maybe the agent is facing south. Forward is south (wall 5), right is east (wall 2). The key is 1 left (east) and 3 forward (south). So east is right, which has a wall 2 steps. But the key is east 1 and south 3. Again, the wall is blocking that path. 

This is confusing. Maybe the agent's current direction is north. Then forward is north (wall 5), right is east (wall 2). The key is 1 left (west) and 3 forward (north). But north is blocked. So how can the key be 3 steps forward? Maybe the key is in a different quadrant. 

Alternatively, perhaps the key is not directly aligned. Maybe the agent needs to turn left (west) and then move forward 3 steps, but there's a wall 5 steps forward (which would be north now). Wait, if facing west, forward is west, which has a wall 5 steps. So moving west 3 steps would hit the wall after 5. That's not possible. 

Wait, maybe the agent isn't facing north, east, south, or west? Or maybe the walls are in different relative positions. Alternatively, maybe the agent has turned multiple times, changing directions each time, leading to different perceived directions. 

Alternatively, perhaps the key is 1 step to the agent's left and 3 steps forward, but the forward direction isn't blocked after those steps. For example, if the agent turns left (west), then moves forward 3 steps, but the wall is only 5 steps forward in the original direction. Wait, this is getting too tangled. 

Maybe the best approach is to look at the key's position relative to the agent. The key is 1 step left and 3 steps forward. So the agent needs to turn left to face the direction of the key's left, which would be north if the agent is facing east, or west if facing south, etc. Then move forward 3 steps. But the problem is that there's a wall 5 steps forward. So if the agent's forward direction is blocked by a wall after 5 steps, but the key is only 3 steps forward, maybe the wall isn't in the same direction. 

Wait, perhaps the walls are in different relative positions based on the agent's current facing. For example, if the agent is facing east, forward is east (wall 5), right is south (wall 2). The key is left (north) 1 and forward (east) 3. But east is blocked. That can't be. 

Alternatively, if the agent is facing north, forward is north (wall 5), right is east (wall 2). The key is left (west) 1 and forward (north) 3. So west 1 and north 3. From the agent's position, moving west 1 would take them to a spot where north 3 steps would reach the key. But there's a wall 5 steps north. So moving west 1 and then north 3 would require that the wall is only 5 steps north from the original position, not from the new position. So if the agent moves west 1, then the wall is 5 steps north from there, which would mean the key at north 3 from the new position (which is west 1 from original) is possible. So the agent can go west 1, then north 3. But how to get there given the possible actions. 

But the agent's current actions are turning left or right. So maybe the agent needs to turn left (west), then go forward 3 steps. But the wall is 5 steps forward in the original direction (north). But if the agent is now facing west, the wall 5 steps forward would be west. But the key is west 1 and north 3. That doesn't align. 

I'm getting stuck here. Let me think differently. The key is 1 left and 3 forward. The agent needs to face a direction where left is towards the key's left and forward is towards the key's forward. Wait, maybe the agent should turn left once, then move forward 3 steps. But the observation says there's a wall 5 steps forward. If after turning left, the forward direction is now the direction where the wall is 5 steps away. For example, if the agent turns left (west), then forward is west, which has a wall 5 steps. But the key is west 1 and north 3. So moving west 1 would take the agent to a spot where north 3 steps would reach the key, but moving west 1 is allowed (since the wall is 5 steps west from original position). Wait, but if the agent is at position (0,0), facing east. The wall is 5 steps east (so at (5,0)). The key is 1 left (north) 1 and forward (east) 3. Wait, that would be at (3,1). But the wall is at (5,0). So from (0,0), facing east, the key is at (3,1). To get there, the agent needs to move north 1 and east 3. But how? The agent can't move diagonally. So they need to turn north (left), then move forward 3 steps east? No, that wouldn't work. 

Alternatively, the agent needs to go north 1, then east 3. But how to do that with the given actions. Turn left (north), go forward 1, then turn right (east), go forward 3. But the problem is that the current observation doesn't mention any walls in those directions. The walls mentioned are 5 steps forward (east) and 2 steps left (north). So if the agent is facing east, left is north, which has a wall 2 steps. So moving north 1 is possible, then east 3. But the key is at (3,1), which is east 3 from (0,0) north 1. That would require the agent to go north 1, then east 3. But the wall is 2 steps north (from facing east's perspective), which would be at (0,2). So moving north 1 is okay, then east 3 steps to (3,1), which is the key. 

But how does the current observation fit into this? The current observation after turning left a few times says walls are forward 5, right 2, and key is left 1 and forward 3. If the agent is now facing north, then forward is north (wall 5), right is east (wall 2). The key is left (west) 1 and forward (north) 3. Wait, that would mean the key is at (-1, 3), which doesn't make sense if the agent is at (0,0). 

I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let's try to stick to the latest observation. The key is 1 step left and 3 forward. The agent needs to face a direction where left is towards the key's left and forward is towards the key's forward. For the key to be 1 left and 3 forward, the agent should turn left once, making their left direction align with the key's left. Then move forward 3 steps. 

But wait, after turning left, the agent's forward direction would be the previous left. So if the agent turns left, their new forward is left, and new left is backward. So to get to the key, which is 1 step left (from agent's original left) and 3 forward (original forward), after turning left, the key would be 1 step backward and 3 forward. That doesn't make sense. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should turn right. Let's say the agent turns right, making their new forward direction the original right. Then the key is 1 step left (original left) and 3 forward (original forward). After turning right, the agent's forward is right, left is original forward. So the key is 1 step to the agent's original left and 3 steps original forward. That would place the key 1 left and 3 forward from the agent's original position. So to reach it, the agent needs to move 1 step original left and 3 steps original forward. But how? The agent can't move diagonally. They have to turn and go forward. 

If the agent turns left (original left direction), then their forward is now original left. So moving forward 1 step would get them to the key's left position, but they need to go 3 steps forward (original forward). So after turning left, moving forward 1, then turning around (180 degrees) and moving forward 3? That seems complicated and possibly against the tip of not repeating actions. 

Alternatively, the agent could turn right (original right), then move forward 3 steps in that direction, but the key is not in that direction. 

This is really tricky. Maybe the correct action is to turn left or right to face a direction where the key is in a straight path, then move forward. 

Looking at the current observation again: walls forward 5, right 2, key 1 left and 3 forward. The agent must be facing a direction where forward is blocked by a wall 5 steps away, right is blocked by a wall 2 steps. The key is 1 step to the left and 3 steps forward. 

If the agent turns left, their new forward direction is the original left. The key is 1 step to the agent's original left (which is now the agent's back) and 3 steps original forward. So after turning left, the agent's forward is left, so moving forward 1 would take them back 1 from their original position (which might not help). 

Alternatively, if the agent turns right, their new forward direction is original right. The key is 1 step original left and 3 original forward. So after turning right, the key is 1 left (original left) and 3 forward (original forward). To reach it, the agent would need to go left 1 and forward 3, but that's diagonal. 

Perhaps the agent needs to first turn left, then move forward 3 steps (which is original left direction), then turn around and move forward 1. But that seems complicated. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should move forward 3 steps in the original direction, but there's a wall 5 steps forward. So they can't. 

Wait, maybe the agent is facing a direction where the wall is 5 steps forward, but the key is only 3 steps in that direction. So if the agent turns left or right, they can find a path to the key. 

Alternatively, the agent should toggle an object in front of them, but there's a wall, so toggling doesn't make sense. 

The tip says not to repeat the same action if the observation doesn't change. The previous actions were turning right and left alternately. Maybe the agent needs to stop turning and move forward when possible. But currently, moving forward is blocked by a wall. 

Wait, the current observation says there's a wall 5 steps forward. So moving forward isn't possible. The agent can only turn or interact. Since the key is not in front, but to the left and forward, the agent needs to adjust their direction. 

The key is 1 left and 3 forward. So the agent should turn left to face that direction and then move forward 3. But if turning left makes their forward direction the original left, then moving forward 3 would take them 3 steps left, but the key is 1 left and 3 forward. So that doesn't align. 

Alternatively, turning right to face original right, then moving forward 3 steps (original right) but the key is not there. 

Hmm. Maybe the correct action is to toggle, but there's nothing to toggle in front. The observation only mentions walls and the key elsewhere. 

Alternatively, the agent should pick up the key, but the key is not below them; it's in another direction. 

Wait, the key is 1 step left and 3 forward. So the agent needs to reposition themselves. The only way is to turn left or right and then move. 

If the agent turns left, their new forward is original left. Moving forward 3 would take them 3 steps left. Then they need to move forward 1 step (original direction) to reach the key. But how? They can't move diagonally. 

Alternatively, after turning left, move forward 3, then turn right twice (180 degrees) and move forward 1. But that's multiple steps and actions. 

But given the agent's previous moves, they've been alternating between turning right and left. Maybe the agent should continue that pattern to change direction. 

In the current observation, the walls are forward 5, right 2, key left 1 and forward 3. If the agent turns left, their new forward is original left. The key is 1 step original left (which is now the agent's back) and 3 original forward. So turning left and moving forward wouldn't help. 

If the agent turns right, their new forward is original right. The key is 1 step original left and 3 original forward. So after turning right, the agent's forward is right, left is original forward. The key is 1 step to the agent's original left (which is now the agent's left when facing right) and 3 steps original forward (which is the agent's back). That doesn't seem helpful. 

Wait, maybe the agent should turn around. If they turn left twice (180 degrees), they face the opposite direction. Then forward would be the original backward. The key is 1 left and 3 forward in the original direction. If the agent is now facing opposite, forward is backward. The key would be 1 left (which is now the original right) and","

Your previous output did not contain a valid action. Defaulted to action: go forward

Observation:
a wall 4 steps forward
a wall 2 steps right
a purple key 1 step left and 2 steps forward",0,False
7,Failed to obtain a valid action from the reasoning.,"<reasoning>
The agent is trying to get to the purple key. The last observation before the error shows the key at 3 steps right and 1 forward after turning right, but after some back-and-forth turning, the current observation has the key at 1 step left and 2 steps forward with walls ahead and to the right.

First, I need to figure out the agent's current direction. The history shows a lot of turning left and right. Let's assume the agent started facing a certain direction. Each turn left or right changes their facing. Let's say initially facing north.

After turning right (action 1), facing east. Then turn right again (action 2) facing south. Then turn left (action 3) facing west. Then turn right (action 4) back to north. Then turn left (action 5) facing west again. Then turn right (action 6) to north. The direction is getting a bit confusing. 

In the last valid observation, after turning right, the key is 1 step left and 3 steps forward. Now the new observation has the key at 1 step left and 2 steps forward, and walls ahead (4 steps) and right (2 steps). So the agent must have moved forward once, maybe. But the key's position changed slightly. 

The goal is to reach the key. If the key is 1 step left and 2 steps forward, the agent needs to adjust their direction to face towards the key. If they're facing north, then left would be west. So turning left would face west, and then move forward. But there's a wall 2 steps to the right (which would be east if facing north), but in the current observation, the wall is 2 steps right, which if facing north, right is east, but the wall is there. So moving forward would hit the wall. Therefore, can't go forward. 

The key is 1 left (west) and 2 forward. If the agent turns left (to face west), then they can move forward 2 steps to reach the key. But need to check if there are walls in the way. The observation says a wall 4 steps forward, which if facing west, that would be in front of them. Wait, the current observation says wall 4 steps forward and wall 2 steps right. If facing north, forward is north, but the wall 4 steps forward would be north. But the key is 1 left (west) and 2 forward (north). So maybe after turning left to face west, moving forward towards the key. But the observation mentions a wall 4 steps forward when facing north, but if facing west, the forward direction would be west, and the wall's position would be different. Wait, the observation is relative to the agent's current direction. So if the agent is facing west, then ""forward"" is west, ""right"" would be south. But the observation states a wall 4 steps forward (west) and a wall 2 steps right (south). So moving forward towards the key (which is 1 step left from west, but that would be north? Wait, maybe the agent's direction is different. Let me retrace.

This is getting complicated. Maybe the best approach is to face towards the key. The key is 1 step left and 2 steps forward. So if the agent turns left (which would make their direction perpendicular to the key's position), then they can move forward towards the key. Alternatively, if they turn around, but that might not be efficient. 

Alternatively, if the agent is facing north, the key is west (1 step left) and north (2 steps forward). But there's a wall 4 steps north. So moving forward from north would hit the wall. So the agent can't go straight north. Therefore, they need to go west first, then north. But how?

If the agent turns left (west), then moves forward 1 step (but the key is 3 steps right and 1 forward previously, but now it's 1 left and 2 forward). Wait, the key's position is relative to the agent's current orientation. So if the agent is facing west, the key being 1 step left would be south, and 2 steps forward would be further west. That doesn't make sense. Maybe the key's position is in terms of the agent's current facing. Let me clarify:

The observation states the key's position relative to the agent's current direction. For example, if the agent is facing north, ""1 step left and 2 steps forward"" would mean the key is 1 step to the west (left) and 2 steps north (forward) from the agent's current position.

So in the current observation, the key is 1 step left (west) and 2 steps forward (north). But there's a wall 4 steps forward (north), so the agent can't go straight north. Therefore, they need to go west first, then north. 

To go west, the agent needs to turn left (if facing north) or right (if facing south). But based on previous actions, the agent's current direction is a bit unclear. Let's assume the agent is facing north after the last few turns. 

If facing north, key is west (left) and north (forward). Wall 4 steps north, so can't go forward. So turn left to face west, then move forward. But the key is 1 step left and 2 steps forward from the agent's current position. Wait, if the agent is facing north, and turns left to face west, then moving forward would take them west. The key is 1 step left (from agent's current position, which is north) west and 2 steps forward (north). So if the agent turns left (west), then moves forward, they would be going west, which would get them closer to the key's westward position. But the key is also 2 steps north. So maybe after moving west once, the agent would need to turn north (but how?)

Alternatively, perhaps the agent needs to move in a direction that aligns them to approach the key without hitting the wall. Given that moving forward hits a wall (4 steps forward), the agent can't go straight north. So they need to adjust their path. 

If the agent turns left (west), moves forward until they can't, then turns north (which would be a 180 from west, so south?), but that might not be right. Wait, turning left from west would face south. Hmm. This is getting confusing. 

Alternatively, if the agent turns right (east), but there's a wall 2 steps right (east), so that's not helpful. 

The key is at 1 step left and 2 steps forward. If the agent turns left (west), then moves forward. Let's say they move forward once. Now they are one step west. The key is 1 step left (which from west would be south) and 2 steps forward (east). But that seems off. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the key's position. 

Alternatively, the key's position is relative to the agent's current direction. So if the agent is facing north, the key is 1 step to the left (west) and 2 steps forward (north). But the wall is 4 steps forward (north), so the agent can't go straight. Therefore, they need to go west first, then north. 

So to get west, turn left (face west), move forward. But after moving west once, the agent's new position is west of where they were. Then, from there, to get north, they need to turn left again (face north), but there's a wall 4 steps forward (north). So that's not possible. 

Alternatively, from facing west, the agent can move forward until they hit the wall (which is 4 steps away), but that's not helpful. 

Hmm. Maybe the agent needs to adjust their direction differently. Let's think again. The key is 1 step left and 2 steps forward. If the agent turns left, they face the direction of the key's left (which would be south if the key is north). This is getting too tangled. 

Alternatively, the agent could use the toggle action, but there's nothing to interact with in front of them except walls. The key is not directly in front, so the agent needs to navigate to it. 

Wait, the key is 1 step left and 2 steps forward. So the agent needs to turn left to face the direction of the left (which would be west if currently facing north), then move forward 2 steps. But moving forward 2 steps from facing west would take them west, but the key is 1 step left (west) and 2 steps forward (north). So perhaps after turning left (west), the agent needs to move forward 2 steps west, then turn north (which would be a 90-degree turn left again) and move forward 1 step. But that requires navigating around the wall. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent can move left (west) once, then turn north (left again) and move forward. But there's a wall 4 steps forward when facing north. 

This is complicated. Maybe the best action here is to turn left to face west and move forward towards the key. But if moving forward from west hits a wall, then that's not possible. The observation says a wall 4 steps forward when facing north, but if the agent is facing west, the wall's position would be different. Wait, the observation is given relative to the agent's current direction. So if the agent is facing west, the wall 4 steps forward would be 4 steps west. But in the current observation, after turning right and left multiple times, the walls are in different positions. 

Alternatively, maybe the agent should turn left to face the direction where the key is left and forward. If the key is 1 step left and 2 steps forward, turning left would align the agent to face the direction where left is towards the key. 

Alternatively, perhaps the agent needs to alternate turning left and right to adjust their path. 

Another approach: The key is nearby (1 left, 2 forward). Since moving forward hits a wall, the agent can't go straight. So they need to go around. Turning left (west), moving forward until they can, but the wall is 4 steps forward when facing north, but if facing west, the wall's position might be different. Wait, the observation says a wall 5 steps forward initially, but now it's 4 steps. The agent must have moved forward once. 

In the current observation, the wall is 4 steps forward and 2 steps right. If the agent is facing north, forward is north, right is east. The key is west (left) and north (forward). So the agent can't go north past the wall. Therefore, they need to go west first. 

So turn left (to face west), then move forward. Since the key is 1 step left (west) and 2 steps forward (north), moving west once would put the agent one step west. Then, they need to face north and move, but there's a wall 4 steps north. So that's not possible. 

Hmm. Maybe the agent needs to turn right instead. If facing north, turn right to face east. But there's a wall 2 steps east. Can't move there. 

This is tricky. The agent needs to reach the key which is west and north, but blocked by a wall to the north. So perhaps the agent has to go around the wall by going west, then south, then north. But how? 

Alternatively, maybe the agent made a mistake in their previous turns and is now circling around. The tips say not to repeat the same action if nothing changes. The agent has been turning left and right repeatedly, which might not be effective. 

In the current observation, the key is 1 left and 2 forward. The agent can't move forward because of the wall. So the best action is to turn left to face the direction of the key's left (west) and move forward. But if moving forward from west hits a wall, then that's not possible. But the observation doesn't mention a wall in front when facing west. The previous walls were when facing north or east. 

Wait, the current observation says a wall 4 steps forward and 2 steps right. If the agent is facing north, forward is north (hits the wall), right is east (wall there). If the agent turns left (west), forward would be west. The observation doesn't mention a wall in front when facing west, so maybe moving forward is possible. 

So the plan: Turn left (face west), then move forward 1 step. That would get the agent closer to the key's westward position. Then, from there, turn left again (face north) and move forward 1 step towards the key's remaining northward distance. But there's a wall 4 steps north when facing north, so moving forward once might still be possible if it's not immediately blocked. 

Alternatively, after moving west once, the key is now at 0 steps left (since agent is facing west and key is 1 step left from original position, which would be 1 step south from the agent's new position) and 2 steps forward (east). So the key is south and east? That doesn't seem right. 

I'm getting confused with the relative directions. Maybe the best approach is to try to face the direction of the key and move. Since the key is 1 left and 2 forward, turning left would align the agent to face the direction where left is towards the key. Wait, no. If the agent is facing north and turns left (west), their new left is south. The key is 1 step left (west) and 2 steps forward (north). So from the agent's new position (facing west), the key is 1 step north and 2 steps east. That doesn't make sense. 

Maybe I need to visualize the grid. Let's assume the agent is at position (0,0), facing north. The key is at (-1, 1) (1 step west and 1 step north). The wall is at (0,4) (4 steps north). 

To reach the key, the agent needs to go west to (-1,0), then north to (-1,1). But there's a wall at (0,4), but that's further north. The problem is the wall at (0,4) blocks the straight north path. 

So the agent can go west to (-1,0), then try to go north. But from (-1,0), facing north, moving forward would take them to (-1,1), which is the key. But wait, is there a wall in between? The current observation says when facing north, there's a wall 4 steps ahead, but that's from the agent's original position. From (-1,0), facing north, how far is the wall? It depends on the map layout, which we don't have. 

Assuming there's no wall between (-1,0) and (-1,1), then the agent can move north from there. But the problem is the agent needs to adjust their path. 

So the steps would be: Turn left (face west), move forward once to (-1,0). Then turn left again (face north), and move forward once to (-1,1), which is the key. 

But how does the current observation reflect this? The current observation after moving west once would have the key at 1 step north and 0 steps left (since agent is facing west). But the observation given is that the key is 1 step left and 2 steps forward from the agent's current position. 

This is getting too complicated without knowing the exact map layout. Given the tips, the agent should avoid repeating the same action. Previous actions were turning left and right, which might not be leading anywhere. 

Another angle: The agent needs to reach the key without hitting walls. The key is nearby, so maybe the agent should try to move in the direction that gets them closer. The key is 1 left and 2 forward. If the agent can't go forward due to the wall, they should turn left to face west and move forward. Even if there's a wall further ahead, moving one step west might get them closer. 

In the current observation, the agent can't move forward (wall 4 steps ahead), so turning left and moving forward is the only viable option that changes the situation. 

So the chosen action would be to turn left and then move forward. But the previous action was turning left, leading to this observation. The agent must alternate directions. 

Wait, the last action before this observation was turn left, leading to the current state where the key is 1 left and 2 forward. Now, the agent can't go forward, so they need to adjust direction. 

So the best action is to turn right this time. If the agent was facing west after turning left, turning right would face north again. Then move forward 1 step. But there's a wall 4 steps north. So moving forward would hit the wall. 

Alternatively, turn left again (face south), move forward, but that's away from the key. 

Hmm. This is really challenging. Given the information, the most logical step is to turn left and move forward, even if there's a wall further ahead, because it might get the agent closer to the key. 

Wait, but in the current observation, after turning left, the key is 1 left and 2 forward. If the agent turns left again (now facing south), the key's position would be 1 step right (north) and 2 steps forward (south). That's worse. 

Alternatively, turn right from the current facing direction. If the agent was facing west, turning right would face south. The key is 1 step left (west) and 2 steps forward (north), which from facing south would be 1 step east and 2 steps north. Not helpful. 

I think the best bet here is to turn left to face west and move forward once. This action would change the agent's position and possibly get them closer to the key. Even if there's a wall further ahead, moving one step west might reveal a path. 

So the action would be go forward after turning left. But the previous action was turning left, leading to this observation. The agent needs to do something different. 

Wait, the agent's previous action was turn left, leading to the current observation. Now, to avoid repeating the same action, they shouldn't turn left again. So they should turn right. 

If the agent turns right (from facing west, turning right faces south), then moves forward. The key is 1 step left (west) and 2 steps forward (north). From facing south, moving forward would take them south, which is away from the key. 

Alternatively, after turning right (south), the agent could turn left again (face west), but that's back to previous direction. 

This is really stuck. Maybe the agent needs to use the toggle action, but there's nothing to interact with. The key is not in front, so toggle won't help. 

Alternatively, the agent could try to move in a different pattern. For example, turn right, move forward if possible, then turn left, etc. 

Given the current observation and constraints, the best action is","

Your previous output did not contain a valid action. Defaulted to action: go forward

Observation:
a wall 3 steps forward

8,Failed to obtain a valid action from the reasoning.,"<reasoning>
Let me try to figure out what action I should take here. The current observation says there's a wall 3 steps forward, a wall 2 steps to the right, and the purple key is 1 step left and 1 step forward.

First, I need to understand my current direction. From previous observations, the agent kept turning right and left to navigate around the walls. Let's assume after the last few turns, now the agent is facing a direction where moving forward would get closer to the key.

The key is 1 step left and 1 step forward. So, if the agent is facing north, for example, left would be west and forward would be north. So the key is west and one step north from the current position. But there's a wall 3 steps forward (north), so moving straight north isn't possible. The other wall is 2 steps to the right, which, if facing north, would be east.

The agent needs to reach the key without hitting the walls. The key is 1 step left and 1 step forward. So the agent needs to move left (west) once and then forward (north) once. But moving forward directly is blocked by a wall 3 steps away. Wait, but the key is only 1 step forward. So maybe the agent can adjust its direction to face a path that leads to the key.

Wait, maybe the agent is facing east. Then left would be north, and forward is east. But there's a wall 3 steps forward (east), so moving east isn't possible. The key is 1 step left (north) and 1 step forward (east). But forward is blocked. Hmm, this is confusing. Let's try to track the agent's direction over time.

Looking at the previous steps: the agent kept toggling between turning right and left. Let's say the initial direction was north. First, they turned right (now facing east). Then turned right again (south), then left (west), right (north), left (west), right (north), etc. This could be navigating in a square pattern to avoid walls.

In the last few observations, after turning right and left multiple times, the agent's path might have the key in a position that's 1 step left and 1 step forward. Let's think: if the agent is facing west, then left would be south, and forward is west. The key is 1 step left (south) and 1 step forward (west). But moving forward (west) would take them towards the key. However, there's a wall 2 steps to the right. If facing west, right would be north, and there's a wall 2 steps north. But the key is south and west. Wait, maybe the agent needs to face a different direction.

Alternatively, if the agent is facing south, left would be east, and forward is south. The key is 1 step left (east) and 1 step forward (south). But moving forward south is blocked by a wall 3 steps away. That doesn't work. 

Alternatively, if the agent is facing north, left is west, forward is north. The key is west 1 and north 1. But moving north is blocked by a wall 3 steps away, but the key is only 1 step north. So perhaps the agent can move north once, then west? But how? If facing north, moving forward (north) would hit the wall after 3 steps, but the key is 1 step north. Maybe there's a way to navigate around.

Wait, the key is 1 left and 1 forward. Let's map this. Suppose the agent is at position (0,0). If the key is at (-1, 1), that would be 1 step left (west) and 1 step forward (north). But there's a wall 3 steps forward (north). So the agent can't go straight north. So maybe the agent needs to go west first, then north. But how?

Alternatively, if the agent is facing east, left is north, forward is east. The key is north 1 and east 1. But moving east is blocked by a wall. So the agent can't go east. So perhaps they need to turn left (north) and move forward, but then the wall is 3 steps forward (north). The key is 1 step north. So moving north once would reach the key? But there's a wall 3 steps north, meaning there's a wall somewhere in the north direction. Wait, the observation says a wall 3 steps forward, which would be in the direction the agent is facing. So if the agent is facing north, moving forward 3 steps hits a wall, but the key is 1 step north. That suggests that there's a wall beyond the key? Or maybe the key is past the wall? That can't be. So perhaps the wall is blocking the path to the key. Wait, but the key is in the observation, so it must be accessible. Therefore, the agent must find a path around the walls to reach the key.

This is getting a bit complicated. Let's try to think step by step. The agent's goal is to get the purple key. The key is 1 step left and 1 step forward. The agent needs to adjust direction to face a path that leads to the key without hitting walls.

If the agent is facing west, left is south, forward is west. The key is west 1 and south 1. Moving west once would get to the key's position, but then moving south would take them further. But the key is at (-1, 0) if facing west, but the observation says it's 1 step left and 1 forward. Wait, maybe the directions are relative to the agent's current facing.

Let me clarify the directions. The agent has a current facing direction (let's assume north initially). The observations describe the positions relative to the agent's current facing. So ""left"" is the agent's left, ""forward"" is the direction they're facing.

In the last observation, the key is 1 step left and 1 step forward. So if the agent is facing north, left is west, forward is north. The key is west 1 and north 1. But moving forward (north) 3 steps hits a wall. But the key is only 1 step north. So there's a wall 3 steps north, meaning there's a wall somewhere up north, but the key is past that? That doesn't make sense. Therefore, the agent must be facing a different direction.

Alternatively, if the agent is facing east, left is north, forward is east. The key is north 1 and east 1. But moving east is blocked by a wall 2 steps away. So the agent can't go east. They would have to go north first, but moving north would hit a wall 3 steps away. So maybe the agent needs to turn left (north) and move forward, but then the wall is in the way. 

Alternatively, if the agent is facing south, left is east, forward is south. The key is east 1 and south 1. Moving south would hit a wall 3 steps away. Moving east would hit a wall 2 steps away. 

Hmm. This is tricky. Maybe the agent needs to adjust its direction to face a path that allows it to approach the key. Let's think: the key is 1 left and 1 forward. So the agent needs to turn left to face the direction of the key's left (which would be the agent's forward), then move forward. Or maybe turn in a way that aligns their movement with the key's position.

Wait, if the agent is facing north, and the key is 1 left (west) and 1 forward (north), then to get to the key, they need to move west first, then north. But how? Because moving west would require not hitting the wall. But the wall is 2 steps to the right (east). If facing north, right is east. So there's a wall 2 steps east, but that's not blocking the path west. So the agent could turn left (west), move forward once to reach the key's x-coordinate, then turn north (which would be their right turn) and move forward once. But how do they turn north from west? Turning right from west would face north.

Alternatively, if the agent is facing west, the key is 1 left (south) and 1 forward (west). So moving forward (west) once would bring them to the key's position. But the observation says there's a wall 2 steps to the right (north). If facing west, right is north, and the wall is 2 steps north. That doesn't block the path west. So moving forward once would get the key. But why wasn't the key picked up yet? Because maybe the previous steps didn't lead the agent to that position.

Wait, in the last few observations, the agent was alternating between turning right and left, trying to navigate around the walls. Let's consider the latest observation:

Observation:
a wall 3 steps forward
a wall 2 steps right
a purple key 1 step left and 1 step forward

Assuming the agent is facing north, left is west. The key is west 1 and north 1. The wall 3 steps forward is north. So moving north would hit the wall after 3 steps, but the key is only 1 step north. That's a contradiction. Unless the wall is somewhere else. Maybe the wall is northeast or northwest? Wait, the observation just says ""a wall 3 steps forward"", which would be straight ahead in the agent's facing direction. So if facing north, it's a wall 3 steps north. The key is 1 step west and 1 step north. So the key is at (-1, 1), and the wall is at (0,3). So there's a clear path from (0,0) to (-1,1), but the agent is blocked from moving north directly because of the wall further north. But that doesn't make sense because the key is north of the agent. So perhaps the wall is blocking the path to the key. That can't be right. The key must be accessible.

This suggests that there's a misunderstanding in the agent's orientation. Maybe the agent is facing a different direction. Let's try assuming the agent is facing east. Then left is north, forward is east. The key is north 1 and east 1. The wall 3 steps forward is east. So moving east would hit the wall, but the key is east 1. That would mean the key is beyond the wall, which is impossible. Therefore, the agent can't be facing east.

If the agent is facing south, left is east, forward is south. The key is east 1 and south 1. Wall 3 steps forward is south. So moving south would hit the wall, but the key is south 1. Again, impossible.

If the agent is facing west, left is south, forward is west. The key is south 1 and west 1. Wall 3 steps forward is west. So moving west would hit the wall, but the key is west 1. Also impossible.

This is perplexing. There must be a mistake in my assumptions. Let me re-examine the observations.

In the latest observation, the wall is 3 steps forward, 2 steps right, and the key is 1 left and 1 forward. Let's consider that the agent's current facing direction is such that left and forward align with the key's position.

Suppose the agent is facing north. Then left is west. The key is west 1 and north 1. The wall is north 3. So the path from the agent's position (0,0) to the key (-1,1) is blocked by a wall at (0,3). That doesn't make sense because the key is at (-1,1), which is north and west of the agent. The wall is much further north. So the agent can move west to (-1,0), then north to (-1,1) to get the key. But how do they get there without hitting the wall?

Wait, the wall is 3 steps forward (north), so from (0,0), moving north 3 steps would hit the wall at (0,3). But the key is at (-1,1). So the agent can move west once to (-1,0), then north once to (-1,1), which is the key's position. But moving north from (-1,0) would be one step, which is allowed since the wall is at (0,3). So the path is possible.

So the agent needs to turn left (west), move forward to (-1,0), then turn north (which would be their right turn from west), and move forward once to get the key.

But how does the agent know to do that? The previous actions were turning right and left to navigate around the walls. Maybe the agent is now facing a direction where turning left leads them west towards the key.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent is facing west. Then left is south, forward is west. The key is south 1 and west 1. Moving forward (west) once would get to (-1,0), then turning left (south) and moving forward once would reach (-1,-1), which isn't the key. This doesn't align.

This is getting too confusing. Let's try to think of the simplest path. The key is 1 left and 1 forward. So the agent needs to turn left, move forward once, then turn forward (which would be their original direction) and move forward once. But that would require the agent to be facing a direction where turning left and moving forward gets them to the key's left, then moving forward gets them to the key.

Alternatively, if the agent turns right, moves forward, then turns right again, etc., but that might not help.

Wait, maybe the agent needs to pick up the key, which is 1 left and 1 forward. So the agent needs to face a direction where their left and forward align with the key's position. For example, if the agent is facing north, left is west, forward is north. So to get the key, they need to move west 1 and north 1. But how to do that without hitting the wall north.

Alternatively, the agent could turn left (west), move forward once to reach the key's x-coordinate, then turn north (their right) and move forward once to reach the key.

So the sequence would be: turn left, go forward, turn right, go forward, then pick up.

But in the current observation, after turning left and moving forward, would the key be beneath the agent? Let's see. If the agent is facing north, turns left (west), moves forward once to (-1,0). Then turns right (north), moves forward once to (-1,1), which is the key's position. Then the agent can pick up the key.

But how does the agent know to do this? The previous actions were turning around to avoid walls. Maybe the agent needs to adjust their direction now.

In the current observation, the wall is 3 steps forward, 2 steps right, and the key is 1 left and 1 forward. If the agent turns left, their new forward direction would be west. Moving forward once would get them to the key's x-coordinate. Then they can turn right (north) and move forward once to the key's position.

So the actions would be: turn left, go forward, turn right, go forward, pick up.

But in the current step, the agent needs to choose the next action. The first action should be to turn left to face west, then move forward.

But let's check the walls. After turning left, the agent is facing west. The observation says there's a wall 2 steps to the right (which would be north). Moving forward west 1 step is safe, as there's no wall mentioned in that direction. Then turning right (north) and moving forward 1 step would reach the key.

Yes, that makes sense. So the next action should be to turn left to face the correct direction, then move forward.

But wait, the agent's current observation says the key is 1 left and 1 forward. If the agent turns left, then their new forward is west, and left is south. The key is 1 left (south) and 1 forward (west) from their new position. Wait, no. If the agent turns left (west), then their left is south, and forward is west. The key is 1 step left (south) and 1 step forward (west) from their current position. Wait, no. The key's position is relative to the agent's original direction, not the new direction after turning.

No, the observations are always relative to the agent's current facing. So when the agent turns left, their new facing direction changes, and the key's position is still described relative to their original facing.

Wait, no. The observation updates based on the agent's current orientation. So if the agent turns left, the key's position remains 1 left and 1 forward from the agent's new facing.

Wait, this is a critical point. The observations are given in the agent's current coordinate system, which changes as the agent turns. So if the agent turns left, the directions (left, right, forward) all change accordingly. The key's position is always reported relative to the agent's current orientation.

Therefore, in the current observation, the key is 1 left and 1 forward from the agent's current facing. Suppose the agent is facing north. The key is west 1 and north 1. If the agent turns left (west), their new forward is west, left is south. Now, the key's position relative to the new forward would be: from the agent's new position, the key is 1 step left (south) and 1 step forward (west). Wait, that doesn't make sense. The key was originally at (-1,1) if facing north. After turning left to face west, the agent's new position is still (0,0), but their orientation is west. The key is now at (-1,1), which is 1 step north and 1 step east from the agent's new position. But relative to the agent's new facing (west), the key would be 1 step north (left) and 1 step east (backward). That's not helpful.

This suggests that the agent's current facing direction is key. Maybe the agent needs to face a direction where moving left and forward gets them to the key.

Alternatively, perhaps the agent should turn right instead. Let's try that.

If the agent is facing north and turns right (east), their new forward is east. The key is west 1 and north 1 from their original position. Now, relative to facing east, the key is west 2 (left twice) and north 1 (back 1). That's worse.

Hmm. This is really challenging. Maybe the agent needs to move forward even though there's a wall 3 steps away, but the key is only 1 step forward. Wait, but how? If the wall is 3 steps forward, moving forward at all would eventually hit the wall. But the key is 1 step forward, which is past the wall? That doesn't make sense. Therefore, the agent must be","

I need to figure out the next step to get to the purple key. Let's look at the current observation. The agent is facing a wall 2 steps forward and a wall 2 steps to the right. The purple key is 1 step left. So, the agent's current direction must be such that left is the direction where the key is.

Wait, the key is 1 step left. That means if I turn left, I can face the direction where the key is. But I need to check the walls. The agent is blocked 2 steps forward and 2 steps right. So, moving forward or right isn't possible right now. 

If the key is 1 step left, turning left would face the key's direction. Then, after turning left, I can move forward step by step until I reach the key. But first, I need to turn left. Let me confirm the sequence: turn left, then go forward once to grab the key. 

But wait, the key is 1 step left, so after turning left, I can go forward once and pick it up. Since the previous observations had the key further away, maybe the agent adjusted direction each time to approach the key. Now it's directly left, so turning left and moving forward should get there. 

I should check if there's a wall in the new direction after turning left. The current walls are 2 steps forward (original direction) and 2 steps right. After turning left, the forward direction would be the left direction previously. But the key is 1 step in that direction, so no wall there. Therefore, turning left and then going forward once should work. 

So the actions needed are: turn left, then go forward. But the user requires a single action per turn. Since the current observation has the key 1 step left, the immediate action should be to turn left to face it, then next step go forward. But the agent can only perform one action at a time. Since the key is directly left, turning left first is necessary to face it. Then, in the next step, go forward. 

But the problem here is that in the current observation, the key is 1 step left. So the correct action now is to turn left. Once turned left, the next action would be go forward. But since we can only take one action per turn, the first action should be to turn left to face the key's direction. 

Therefore, the chosen action here is to turn left, which will align the agent's direction to face the key, allowing them to pick it up in the next step by moving forward.
