        "The previous up actions did not change the observation which strongly suggests that I am at the top edge of the map and cannot move further up Therefore directly reaching the WIN object by moving up is not possible\n\nMy current objective is to win the level Since I cannot move to the WIN object directly I should consider changing the rules to achieve victory The Tips state: Your goal is usually to reach an object defined as WIN but this can be changed\n\nI can either:\n Change myself to WIN eg BABA IS WIN However the baba is and you text blocks are very far down  steps down making it difficult to rearrange them quickly\n Change another object to WIN and then reach that object\nThe ball object is  steps to the right The is text block is  step left and  step up The win text block is  step up\nIf I can form BALL IS WIN I can then move onto the ball object\n\nTo form BALL IS WIN I need to bring BALL IS and WIN text blocks together\nCurrently:\n ball object not text is  steps to the right\n rule is is  step to the left and  step up\n rule win is  step up\n\nSince I cannot move up I cannot push the win or is text blocks downwards My only option might be to push the ball object towards the is and win text blocks\n\nLets try moving right to get closer to the ball object This will also verify that movement is possible in other directions\n\nright",
