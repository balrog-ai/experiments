        "The goal is to win the level which usually involves reaching an object defined as WIN Currently the only active rule is BABA IS YOU meaning you control Baba\n\nLooking at the map:\n Your character Baba is at position  implied current position\n There is a text block rule win at  which is one step directly above you\n There is a text block rule is at  directly to the left of rule win\n\nIf the rule win text block itself is the win condition then moving up should complete the level However previous attempts to move up have not resulted in a win implying that either:\n The rule win text block is not the win condition itself\n Baba is blocked from moving up to it No STOP rules are active for Baba or the path\n\nThis suggests we need to change the rules to define a new win condition The Tips also mention that Sometimes the solution involves making yourself a different object or changing what counts as the win condition\n\nWe have the following text blocks available to form rules:\n rule is at \n rule win at \n rule ball at \n rule baba at \n Other rule is and rule you further away that form BABA IS YOU\n\nThe rule is and rule win text blocks are already adjacent to each other forming part of a rule like SUBJECT IS WIN To complete this rule we need to bring a subject text block next to them\n\nThe closest subject text block is rule ball at \nOur current position is \n\nLets aim to form the rule BALL IS WIN To do this we need to move the rule ball text block from  to a position like  or  to connect with is and win\n\nTo move rule ball from  towards the is and win blocks:\n We need to move Baba to rule balls position or an adjacent position to push it rule ball is at  We are at \n To get next to rule ball to push it we could move right to  then down three times to  From  we can push rule ball by moving against it\n\nLets move right first to get closer to rule ball\n\nAction: right",
