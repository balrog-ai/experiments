You find yourself in a kitchen. A typical one.

You can see a fridge. The fridge contains a raw white tuna. Now that's what I call TextWorld! You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal an oven. Now why would someone leave that there? You scan the room, seeing a table. On the table you can see a cookbook. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? Oh, great. Here's a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? On the counter you can make out a tomato, a red hot pepper and a yellow apple. What's that over there? It looks like it's a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is an open frosted-glass door leading south. There is an exit to the east. Don't worry, there is no door. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one.
