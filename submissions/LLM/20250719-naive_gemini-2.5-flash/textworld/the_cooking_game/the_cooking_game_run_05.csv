You've just shown up in a bedroom.

You make out a bed. The bed is large. However, the bed, like an empty bed, has nothing on it. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a bed in a room.

You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

Look at you, bigshot, walking into a corridor like it isn't some huge deal.



There is an open sliding patio door leading east. There is an exit to the north. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.

Well, here we are in a kitchen. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure.

You see an opened fridge, which looks conventional, right there by you. The fridge contains a yellow bell pepper. You shudder, but continue examining the room. You can make out an oven. You make out a table. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You see a counter. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You bend down to tie your shoe. When you stand up, you notice a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

There is a closed plain door leading south. There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door.
