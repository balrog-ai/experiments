You arrive in a kitchen. An usual one.

You can make out a fridge. The fridge contains a white onion. You can see a closed conventional looking oven in the room. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a table. The table is massive. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a red hot pepper, so there's that. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a stove. But there isn't a thing on it.

There is a closed frosted-glass door leading north. There is an open patio door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.
